        <b>What's a motherboard?</b><br>
        A motherboard, formerly known as “planar” from the first motherboard in 1981 in IBM personal computers, is often referred to as the “backbone” or “spine of a computer.” It connects all the components of a computer. Motherboards come in many types, all with the same basic parts, each made to work with different types of processors and memory (Volle & Adam, 2023). <br><br>
        <b>Types of Motherboards:</b><br>
        AT (advanced technology) motherboards were introduced in August 1984 by IBM. These were popular in the 1980s in personal computers, measuring only 351 mm by 301 mm, they could only fit in AT computer cases (GeeksforGeeks, 2025). <br> <br>
        ATX (advanced technology extended) is an enhanced version of the AT motherboard that Intel created in July 1995. It replaced the older AT form factor and brought several improvements to the design, including better airflow and reduced heat buildup, easier component installation, and standardized interfaces (ATX: Advanced Technology eXtended - Uncover the Advantages, 2023). <br> <br>
        BTX (balanced technology extended) is a form factor for motherboards and computer cases introduced by Intel. It was designed to address issues with heat management and power consumption found in the ATX form factor. It featured an optimized layout for better airflow and more efficient cooling, which can prolong hardware life and improve system performance. Despite these advantages, it has been phased out in favor of continued use of ATX (Balanced Technology eXtended: A Comprehensive Guide, 2023). <br> <br>
        EATX is a bigger version of the ATX motherboard with  305x330 mm dimensions. While some dual-CPU-socket systems have been implemented in ATX, the extra size of EATX makes it the typical form factor for dual-socket systems and for single-socket systems with a large number of memory slots (Wikipedia contributors, 2025). <br> <br>
        LPX (low-profile extension) motherboards are designed for general use in desktop computers but are smaller compared to a standard ATX motherboard. Known for their unique layout, where expansion cards are mounted parallel to the board through a riser card, improving space and making it a perfect fit for slim or compact cases (Compact LPX Motherboard Design With Socket 462 Explained, 2023). <br> <br>
        The Micro ATX is a compact version of the standard ATX motherboard, offering a smaller form factor while maintaining backward compatibility with ATX-sized cases. It supports many of the same components as the standard ATX, but differs mainly in having fewer expansion slots (The Complete Guide to Motherboard Form Factor Varieties-C&T Solution Inc. | 智愛科技股份有限公司, n.d.). <br> <br>
        The Mini-ITX is the pioneer among various ITX sizes, as it was specifically designed for compact applications like in-vehicle computers and industrial automation, commonly found in the embedded space. Suitable for physically constrained spaces, low power consumption, and the ability to utilize passive cooling through heatsinks. <br> <br>
        Mini-ATX is a smaller form factor motherboard standard that falls between the standard ATX and the smaller micro-ATX sizes. It measures 15x15 cm and is designed to fit into smaller computer cases while still providing a balance of expandability and compatibility (Mini-ATX: Compact Power for Efficient Builds, 2023). This motherboard is essentially obsolete today, superseded by Micro ATX and Mini-ITX standards. <br> <br>
        Pico BTX motherboards are known for their compact size and are an excellent choice for building a Hackintosh (desktop Mac) computer. This is ideal for builds where space is a crucial consideration for your computing needs (Younas, 2024).
