        <b>What is Data?</b><br>
        Data is raw information or undefined facts, from numerical values and symbolic representations to textual content and visual imagery. Data can be categorized into quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data is numerical and measurable, dealing with values that can be expressed mathematically, like an object's mass, volume, density, and so on. Quantitative data has two types: discrete data and continuous data. Discrete data focuses on finite values that can be counted, often represented by whole numbers like the number of students in a room, the number of eggs in a carton. Continuous data, on the other hand, represents values split within a range, giving precise measurements for characteristics like height, weight, temperature, and duration. This differs from Qualitative data, where it’s descriptive and non-numerical, involving qualities and attributes that cannot be measured by numbers, often subjective and interpretive. Under quantitative data are nominal data and ordinal data. Nominal data assigns elements into discrete categories where order is not applied, like religion, nationality, blood type, and marital status. Ordinal data assigns elements in ordered categories in relative position without specifying the exact distance between them. Examples of this would be education level, class standing, movie ratings, and socioeconomic status. <br><br>
        <b>What is Information?</b><br>
        Information is processed data that’s organized, interpreted, and structured. This helps us make logical decisions, form strategies, and plan actions. The conversion of data to information involves the following steps: Processing, Organizing, Interpreting, and Structuring. The way data is processed is through cleaning and preparing data for analysis, which could include removing duplicates and correcting errors. Then it is structured and categorized to make it easier to understand. Then it is refined into actionable insights by highlighting patterns, trends, and relationships. Then finally information is presented concisely and is accessible (Jain, 2025). <br><br>

        <b>Information Systems</b><br>
        An information system is an interconnected set of components used to collect, store, process, and transmit data and digital information. An information system, at its core, is a collection of software, hardware, data, people, and processes that work together to convert raw data into useful information (Awati, 2024). There are different types of information systems, a few examples would be: Management information system (MIS) that supports management decision making (Staff, 2025), Decision support system (DSS) analyzes data from business performance and makes data-driven decisions (Segal, 2025), Knowledge work system (KWS) provides useful information for knowledge workers like researchers and analysts (Awati, 2024), and Executive information system (EIS) offers high-level information regarding the company’s financial performance, market trends, competitive landscape and so on (Techslang, 2025).
