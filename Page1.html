        <b>Computer Science</b><br>
        Computer Science(CS) is the study of computers and computing, essentially the theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information (Belford et al., 2025). In this field of science, we focus on the theoretical foundations of computation, algorithms, data structures, and the fundamental principles of how computers work. It is part of the family of five interrelated disciplines: Computer engineering, information technology, information systems, computer science, and software engineering. It specializes in, but is not limited to, Artificial intelligence, data science, game design, information systems, and software engineering. <br><br>

        <b>Computer Engineering</b><br>
        Computer Engineering(CE) is a mix of both electrical engineering and computer science in terms of hardware and software. It focuses on how well the hardware and software interact with each other (What Is Computer Engineering? | Michigan Technological University, 2025). Computer Engineers are the ones who make the essential parts of a computer. Parts like the CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, etc. They have distinct career paths such as Hardware Engineer, Hardware Test Engineer, Design Engineer, Embedded Software Engineer, Systems Engineer, and so on.

        <b>Software Engineering</b><br>
        Software Engineering(SE) is the application of Engineering approaches to the development of Software. The software part includes programs, databases, and documentation while using proven systematic principles of engineering to build and design those software systems (Yeboah et al., 2022). Some may confuse SE from CS as both are specialized in the computing aspect. What separates SE from CS is that it mainly focuses on developing systems that consistently do what they’re meant to perform, while CS focuses on innovating new knowledge of computers(Yeboah et al., 2022). Software engineers can take on multiple roles, such as front-end developer, back-end developer, full-stack developer, mobile developer, and AI developer.

        <b>Information Technology</b><br>
        Information Technology(IT) is a field that focuses on the utilization and management of computer systems, networks, and data. It plays an important role in acquiring, storing, processing, and disseminating information (University of North Dakota, 2024). The part that differentiates IT from CS is that they make use of the computer programs developed by CS professionals. They focus on the practical aspects of installing, managing, and optimizing these programs for organizations. IT professionals have different roles in the industry, like Security Engineer, InfoSec Specialist, and Cloud DevOps Engineer.

        <b>Information Systems</b><br>
        Information Systems(IS) differs from IT as it prioritizes more on information handling processes. It is a set of interconnected people, processes, software, hardware, and networks (Schulze, 2025). While IT centers around the technology, the primary focus of IS is to manage data as it flows through the following five stages: Input, processing, storage, output, and feedback. They specialize in fields like Network security support engineer, Information systems security officer, and operating systems engineer.
